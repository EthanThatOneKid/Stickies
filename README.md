## About
This was the very first complete webapp I had created. I created it using only html/css and vanilla javascript in the browser. For my backend, I used Firebase. Since this was my first webapp, there are many things that I would have done differently. As a first-ever webapp, however, I am pretty proud with how it came out.

## Features

* __Create__ *panels* for different topics
