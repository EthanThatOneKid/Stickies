    About
  -->
  <h2 class="subheading">About</h2>
  <p class="docP">
    Welcome to Stickies. This webapp is all about organizing thoughts and plans in a fun, casual manner.
    All you need to do is sign up with an email account by clicking the X on the top right of the console and you are ready to go!
    Once you are signed in, instead of seeing an X in the top right of the console, it will be the first initial of the email account you signed up with.
    Upon account authorization, you have the ability to create, share, edit, and recieve panels.
    These panels are the places in which all of the stickies reside.
    The console and each panel are suited with hot-refresh technology,
    so that whenever there is a change made by another client,
    the updates will appear live on your screen without you having to refresh.
  </p>

  <!--
    CONSOLE
  -->
  <h2 class="subheading">Console</h2>
  <p class="docH">New Panel</p>
  <p class="docP">
    In the console, in order to create a new panel, you need to click on the New Panel button, which resides on the top left.
    Your browser will then react with a prompt, asking you what you would like to name the panel. The name can be changed later.
  </p>
  <p class="docH">My Panels</p>
  <p class="docP">
    Underneath the My Panels heading in the console, there should be a list of panels that you have created.
    If nothing shows up there, that either means that you are not signed in, have not created a panel yet, or they are still loading.
  </p>
  <p class="docH">Shared With Me</p>
  <p class="docP">
    Underneath the Shared With Me heading in the console, there should be a list of panels that you have been shared with you.
    If nothing shows up there, that either means that you are not signed in, have not created a panel yet, or they are still loading.
  </p>
  <p class="docH">Panel Limit</p>
  <p class="docP">
    Underneath the your initial on the top right of the console, you may have noticed a display of how many panels you currently have.
    The initial limit on how many panels you can have is five, but you can increase that thresh by purchasing more panels.
  </p>


  <!--
    PANEL
  -->
  <h2 class="subheading">Panel</h2>
  <p class="docH">New Sticky</p>
  <p class="docP">
    Click the button on the top left of the panel to create a new sticky.
    Sample text will be inside once initialized.
    The sticky itself can be edited at any time by clicking on it and using the rich text editor beneath the large-scaled preview.
    Stickies can be peeled off of the panel by clicking on them and clicking its Peel button.
    Only users with the role of <i>owner</i> can delete stickies from the panel.
    The stickies within the panel are also sortable and the order is retained after refreshing.
  </p>
  <p class="docH">Share</p>
  <p class="docP">
    Upon clicking the Share button at the top of the panel, the browser should react with a prompt.
    In the prompt, type out the email of the person you wish to share your panel with.
    The email that you share your panel to must be the email they used to sign up with Stickies.
    They will then be able to see your panel in their Shared With Me section in their console.
    They can sort, create, and edit all of the stickies in the panel once you give access to them.
  </p>
  <p class="docH">Delete Panel</p>
  <p class="docP">
    Upon clicking the Delete Panel Button, one of two things may happen to you depending on your role.
    If you are the owner of the panel, the panel will be completly deleted with all stickies lost in cyberspace.
    If the panel has been shared with you, the panel will merely be removed from your shared list.
  </p>
  <p class="docH">Changing the Title of the Panel</p>
  <p class="docP">
    In order to change the title of the panel, just click the current title on the top left.
    Upon clicking it, the browser should react with a prompt.
    In the prompt, type out the new name of the panel and press OK.
  </p>
